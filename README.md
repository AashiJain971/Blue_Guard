# 🔵 Blue Guard – SIEM Toolkit for Apache/Nginx Logs (Zero Day Mitigation)
 
**Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, SQLite, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Slack API, LLaMA (GenAI via Together.ai)

## 💡 Overview

**Blue Guard** is a real-time Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) toolkit designed to analyze Apache/Nginx access logs and mitigate suspicious or malicious IP behavior in almost a sec.

This lightweight, modular solution uses both **rule-based detection** and **ML-based anomaly detection**, with support for **GenAI-based explanations**, **live Slack/email alerts**, and **IP blocking at firewall and application layers**.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time ingestion of Apache/Nginx access logs
- ⚙️ Rule-based + ML-based IP detection
- 🧠 GenAI-powered behavioral explanations (LLaMA via Together.ai)(call commented in code to save tokens, but its already been tested, its full working)
- 📩 Slack & email alerts for critical events
- 🔒 Simulated or real IP blocking using application-layer controls
- 🧱 SQLite for persistent log and IP behavior tracking
- 🌐 Flask REST API for modular integration

## 🔐 Use Case

- Protect servers from DDoS, brute-force, scraping, scanning attacks
- Help admins understand anomalies with GenAI insights
- Provide a lightweight SIEM for teams without expensive commercial tools
